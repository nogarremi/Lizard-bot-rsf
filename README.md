# Lizard-BOT

Simple discord bot originally built for the [Online Local](https://twitter.com/theonlinelocal) (formerly r/StreetFighter) East Coast SFV weekly tournament to help players see current round and with some commands for TOs. Support for multiple channels to run multiple tournaments at once and allows for custom prefixes, round flavor text, and more. Requires discord.py and pymysql.

# How to Use

In order to get started, you need to invite Lizard-BOT to the discord server you wish to use to run tournaments.  [Invite link here.](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=317294414374502400&scope=bot&permissions=321600)

Immediately after the bot joins the server use the command `!edit botrole <role>` with the role of your choice to make it so that only those with that role can access the commands meant for the Tournament Organizers. From there, feel free to use all the commands listed below to adjust the bot to your needs.

For more information on setting up the bot for use in a Discord server, please see our documentation [here](https://github.com/lizardman301/Lizard-bot-rsf/blob/master/doc/setting_up_bot_in_discord.md)

### Note about Challonge

If you have a pro-community, use your custom subdomain e.g., **redditfighting** of redditfighting.challonge.com.

If you are **not** a pro-community in Challonge, you will have to find and copy the jumble of symbols that is your community's subdomain. Go to your Challonge community page, and go to community settings. Look for the part that says *Subdomain PRO* and look for the box beneath it. This is your community subdomain.

If the Challonge community tournament does not add the ["LizardBOT" Challonge account](https://challonge.com/users/LizardBOT) as a collaborator or a tournament hosted by a Challonge user, the checkin command **WILL** work but the seeding command will **NOT** work.
This is because tournaments are read-only by default. Any attempts by Lizard-BOT to updating seeding numbers will fail since "LizardBOT" doesn't have permissions.

## TO Commands

These commands will only be available to be used by those with the role mentioned above.

`!botrole`
Returns the role that allows access to the administrator commands.

`!challonge <subcommand> <bracket URL identifier> [OPTIONALS]`
Uses Challonge's API to pull data into Discord

Bracket URL identifier is what comes at the end of the URL
For example
	redditfighting.challonge.com/wwyi8jhk
	Bracket URL identifier = wwyi8jhk
